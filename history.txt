- cache checking
	Version 0.20 wouldn't check to see if it had already cached the cartoon
	before opening the cartoon's web page to extract the filename to see if it
	already existed. Adding code to check the cache folder *before* opening the
	cartoon's web page has significantly decreased the processessing time.
	The limitation on this cache check is that if you change the 'name' element
	for a specific cartoon, is that cached items use the 'name' element as part
	of the cache filename. If you alter the 'name' element, the code will fail
	to locate older cached files. On operating systems that have case-sensitive
	file systems, this can impact even changing a cartoon name from "My Cartoon"
	to "my cartoon". Windows-hosted systems may or may not be affected by
	case-sensitivity issues, but Unix/Linux/BSD systems generally will be
	impacted.
- removed "PC and Pixel" cartoon from cartoons.php
	The author has slipped behind a few days and was always generating a 404
	error when trying to fetch a cartoon based on "today's" date.

- caching
  The tarball now includes a 'cache' folder which you'll need to set the
  permissions to 777 using the CHMOD command in your FTP/ssh program. The
  script will *attempt* to save a copy of the cartoon graphic on your server,
  but after a while this could really add up to a lot of disk space, so be
  sure your hosting account can handle the load, or just delete older graphics
  every month or so.
- handling 404 and regular expression issues
  If the script can't apply a regular expression on a downloaded cartoon page,
  or if the cartoon page is simply unable to be opened, it will show a graphic
  of your choice from the '404comics' page. I used a graphic editor with the
  'Comic Sans MS' font to create my own goofy 'comic is missing' images.
